                    <h2><strong>Personal Profiles</strong></h2>
                    <p><strong>A little about Alessio:</strong></p>
		    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alessio-Rigoli/Assignment3-4/master/assets/img/Alessio.png" alt="" /></span><br /><br /></p>
                    <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student ID:</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> s3775600</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My name is Alessio and I have a background in the I.T industry working as a helpdesk technician dealing with a range of systems including Windows, macOS, Linux as well as Android and iOS. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I originally got my start back at high school where I first learnt about jailbreaking my iPod touch and later learning to gain root access to my old Android phone which led me to various forums and websites where I learnt about custom firmware, custom ROM images and later Linux and open source. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After my first few years of high school I started to become really interested in other aspects of technology including software, blogging, security and around this time launched my website</span><a href="https://agrtech.com.au/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">agrtech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date my education includes successful completion of primary school between 2005-2012 and high school between 2012-2017 and currently studying Introduction to I.T with RMIT university. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My family heritage is Italian and in terms of languages I can speak some Italian. My hobbies include reading, watching movies, reading books, blogging and playing table tennis, which is my favourite sport to play and spending time with our 2 family Labrador's named Max and Ruby.</span></p>
                    <p><strong>A little about Anton:</strong></p>
                    <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alessio-Rigoli/Assignment3-4/master/assets/img/Anton.png" alt="" /><br /><br /></p>
		    <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student ID:</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> s3804317</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My name is ANTON TRAN, I was born in 1977, HO CHI MINH City, VIETNAM. Vietnam, Bali, Thailand are in the top destinations attracting most Australians and Europeans. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I studied engineering in Vietnam university, during the time at university, I found it was too hard for me to complete that degree, because I studied that it was a huge disadvantage for local students to learn all very old formulas from Soviet Communist Science to compare with all new technology, science from Western.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1999, and then I decided to go to Australia to get another opportunity to watch and study how Western people could achieve so many brilliant things of IT, science, medicine, law.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was in high-school, I learned programming by Pascal and Fox language. It was running on MS-DOS, it was complicated in my studying time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Since 2006, I have been working as an accountant for five years. My&nbsp; job was to look after payroll and banking reconciliation. I have been working in the logistics industry for 8 years. I am continuing to study to move forward to get more challenges in the financial field.&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am currently studying for a Degree in Applied Finance at RMIT, and IT is a very important subject for finance, because I would like to work in the stock market, that is the only the most powerful tool to access all information of companies, international markets.</span></p>
                    <p><strong><em>A little about Vignesh:</em></strong></p>
                    <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alessio-Rigoli/Assignment3-4/master/assets/img/Vignesh.png" alt="" /><br /><br /></p>
		    <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student ID: </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">s3826714</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;m an Australian from an Indian background so my culture is a blend between both Australian and Indian. I have lived in this country for 10+ years and completed the majority of my high school education in Melbourne. I also did my bachelor&rsquo;s in science (Electrical Systems) at the University of Melbourne but unfortunately due to work commitments I had to drop the course in my final semester. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After my course, I joined the Australian Defence Force and I have been working in the Army for almost 2 years now. Coming from an Indian background, my family and I are very adaptable, our culture brings a vibrancy to our lives and people around us by the flashy Bollywood movies, music, and our food which also brings families together. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So overall, my Indian culture brings the adaptable, interesting and caring side of my character whereas the Australian culture that I have been accustomed to in recent years brings out the mateship, confidence and independent individual I have become.&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my spare time, I like to explore vast variety of things such as scuba diving, playing sports such as soccer, badminton and swimming. I am also very fond of riding motorcycles which has become the latest of my favourite past times after I got my licence recently and these summer months really allows me to do all the things I love.&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My interest in Information Technology began when I was doing my first bachelors which involved some coding as fundamentals for Electrical Engineering. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially IT was forced on to me although I disliked it very much purely because coming from an Indian social circle, many of my mates and my family friends were in the IT field and I really didn&rsquo;t like what they did for a living. But soon I came to realise that IT is everywhere and it's everything. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s innovation, its creation and its history. Let me explain&hellip; IT allows you to make progress in leaps and bounds relative to anything we have seen in the past, creating things we only dreamt of in the past &ndash; MRI machines, Virtual reality, smart home systems like in Iron Man movies. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a direct result of the things we have learned throughout history which is leading our drive towards innovation and the freedom we have allows us to create whatever our heart desires. This brought out a whole new perspective in me &ndash; to be in the leading edge of innovation, if not at least be up to date with the latest trends and technology &ndash; move forward with the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My experiences with IT are adequate &ndash; I have done courses in C; Java and I have self-taught VBA and python. I have also used Verilog which is a hardware description language used in my previous degree.</span></p>
                    <p><strong>Group Processes</strong></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall the team performed extremely well in assignment 2. We received constructive feedback outlining the changes we needed to make. These included changes to the assignment, noted below, and other minor team specific issues.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changes made this assignment relative to the previous is that we are adding another major component to our project. Initial project plan was to have an arduino board configured to show the temperature and humidity of the surroundings which can later be taken to school and demonstrated to attract more students into the field of information technology. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the feedback received from assignment 2, we thought it was best to add another component which is a chatbot in partnership with the arduino board. These two paired together will assist its user to gain critical weather information of both the surroundings and the chatbot (if connected to the internet) would provide other weather related information to the user.</span></p>
                    <p><strong>Career Plans</strong></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Career plans have not changed since the last assignment. As this is a relatively small group with one of us majoring in finance and the other 2 in information technology the career plans are quite different. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the ones that choose information technology as their career of choice, want to lead 2 vastly different pathways. One wants to go into middle management and lead groups of IT/cyber specialists on a daily basis, where as the other wants to establish a business and lead it to success.&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <h2><strong>Our roles throughout this project</strong></h2>
                    <p><strong>Alessio - Project leader, Website and chatbot designer</strong></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it came to this project we decided as a team to assign the website creation to myself as I have had experience developing websites in the past and also have a variety of templates and comfortable working with GitHub pages. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early on in our planning we decided a chatbot might be a good application of our previous research into technologies that could be nicely integrated with the board assembled by Vignesh. Some of this work included compiling images, writing HTML and fixing formatting before publishing everything on GitHub pages.&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the previous assignment I wrote an article about NLP (Natural language processing) so decided to take a challenge and research the chatbot. Lastly as project leader my responsibilities included organizing meetings with the team and ensuring we all met our deadlines to complete different tasks.&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><strong>Anton - User interface designer</strong></p>
                    <p><span>Honestly, I am completely blank when I begin to participate in the group project. I felt totally lost when I decided to do my own research to catch up with the ideas that come from other members.</span></p>
                    <p><span>However, when I start to go through a team project over and over, I could see somehow it is not the end for the answer. Gradually, I feel more confident and willing to contribute my view and designation to our group.</span></p>
                    <p><strong>Vignesh - Project assistant, Arduino designer</strong></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With prior electronics experience and having studies with electrical systems major, it was natural that the arduino designing aspect of the project would be completed by me. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, the idea began as a educational and inspiring project to engage bright new minds into the world of information technology but soon evolved into a bigger project incorporating chatbots which is capable of providing detailed information to the user. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also having access to a arduino board and having worked with it in the past for several other applications, it was a strategically appropriate to assign me as the arduino designer. In conjunction with Alessio&rsquo;s chatbot and anton&rsquo;s assistance in making it a user friendly device, we managed to make significant progress. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having had some experience in leading teams at both university and professional level, I believed I was the right fit for the project assistant position.</span></p>
                    <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><strong>Group Reflections</strong></h2>
                    <p><strong>Alessio's reflection</strong></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time around communication was much easier as we have all gotten to know each other, similar to the previous task however one issue we ran into was regarding platforms. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We initially opted to use a website called Figma to design the mockup designs however this tool proved to be counter intuitive and not alligned with what we needed. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We then began work on an alternative called gomockingbird which proved to be much easier to work with. Like the previous project we found that sticking to basics proved to be what we needed to stay on track with the same tools used again to complete this project.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In terms of working with the group I again found Anton and Vignesh to be great team members who are both easygoing and were dedicated to making sure every aspect was covered and that we saw this through. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to other work we started by breaking apart the assignment into all the necessary components and then assigned roles to each other enabling us to quickly assemble all content before I took everything and published the website. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main challenge throughout the assignment was initially regular communication to establish the direction of the project however after the first&nbsp; 2 Skype calls this was quickly resolved. All up I have enjoyed working with Anton and Vignesh as well as this entire course with RMIT.</span></p>
                    <p><strong>Anton&rsquo;s Reflection:</strong></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, in the last minute we were notified by admin the team has missed one member, now we only have 3 people in our group, it could be harder for us if we are missing one of the best contributions to our assignment. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Vignesh and Alessio have great experience in the IT industry, our problems have been solved beyond expectation, we have been discussing our project and bring out the best ideas to complete the group assignment. It is the big goal for all of us to focus on and work closely together to understand each other&rsquo;s IT skills. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honestly, I am very fortunate to cooperate with these very special members and we are looking forward to achieving the best results and the most enjoyable time for studying IT.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new assignment has driven us to go further in production details. The new sensor equipment with Arduino system kits have successfully received widely useful information for monitoring and research.</span></p>
                    <p><strong>Vignesh&rsquo;s Reflection:</strong></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe that both Alessio and Anton were great team members. They contributed their side of the personal information/profile as well as pulled their weight when it came to doing the shared parts of the assignment. The things that worked well were rather than the team just piecing together bits of the assignment and submitting it. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all did our share then collaborated and cross-checked the work on google docs to make sure that we did the best we could. The things that didn&rsquo;t work so well were lack of constant communication which could be because we had different schedules and personal commitments. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, we learnt from the previous mistakes but there&rsquo;s always room for more improvement. I&rsquo;d love to work with these 2 again in the future, either at university or workplace doing projects.</span></p>
                    <p><strong>Overall Group Reflection:</strong></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early on we found it difficult on settling for a project idea that we could create a presentation around and that we would use to build on the Arduino system we originally hoped to use.&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a few Skype calls and talking with the group we decided that a chatbot would be a nice addition to the board and could add an extra layer of functionality which could be expanded upon in many different ways.&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we decided we took a similar approach to our last project and started breaking down the document into all the various sub-headings assigning roles along the way to each other to get the job done.&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we learnt from previous assignments keeping things as simple and streamlined as possible was critical along with starting earlier to avoid issues that may set us back.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall we felt like we achieved this and building on our experiences were able to swiftly complete the task at hand and maintain constant communication throughout.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The course has really helped us to be able to go into a random group and get to know each other well to come together and coordinate a successful project.</span></p>
