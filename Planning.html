                  <p><strong>Applications</strong></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This project whilst being simple has many practical applications most notably in agriculture where it could be deployed to monitor humidity levels and other temperature information which would assist farmers in keeping track of their crops. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other cases where it could be useful is for specialised machinery or instruments that must be kept at a constant temperature. This chatbot would be able to quickly alert the user if any temperatures changed.&nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The motivation behind this simple project is education. Although the project is simple enough for a team to build within a reasonable amount of time, the goal of this project is to educate high school children and get them excited about information technology and software/hardware engineering. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The temperature and humidity monitor and the chatbot are interactive and easy for high school children to build over a few sessions which will allow them to gain an appreciation for technology and help guide the interested children to the science and technology pathway. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this project we hope to expose the high school children to minor coding, configuring small electrical components and make it a team building activity.</span></p>
                  <p><strong>Aims</strong></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our project concerns about climate changes have severe impact on our planet. Global warming has been heavily damaged to Australian disasters like bushfires, torrential rain, and the Australian economy. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By bushfire alone, billions of wildlife animals have been taken, and unfortunately some of Australian firefighter volunteers have fatality accidents while on mission, except for the breakout of coronavirus maybe part of our planet event.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our solutions raise the awareness of climate change, and dedicate potential tools engineered high-end technology to enhance the education programs, student activities to outreach on climate change, as well as the possibly accuracy prediction for any coming natural disaster based on our experimental data.</span></p>
                  <p><strong>Group Processes</strong></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall the team performed extremely well in assignment 2. We received constructive feedback outlining the changes we needed to make. These included changes to the assignment, noted below, and other minor team specific issues.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changes made this assignment relative to the previous is that we are adding another major component to our project. Initial project plan was to have an arduino board configured to show the temperature and humidity of the surroundings which can later be taken to school and demonstrated to attract more students into the field of information technology. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the feedback received from assignment 2, we thought it was best to add another component which is a chatbot in partnership with the arduino board. These two paired together will assist its user to gain critical weather information of both the surroundings and the chatbot (if connected to the internet) would provide other weather related information to the user.</span></p>
                  <p><strong>Plans and progress</strong></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project is an enormous challenge for our group to achieve the highest proposal target. Luckily, our group number was reduced to three of us. Therefore, we are simply catching up with the team meeting by instant Facebook messenger, and video skype to keep in touch with the progress of the project.&nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the beginning, everyone in the group was doing a presentation about an individual's project to others, and then we evaluated and nominated the most interesting project to the final assignment. Beyond our expectation, Alessio&rsquo;s project has the common current concerns directly about climate change. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are excited to experiment on the best science strategy to save the future of Australia for the survival of human species, flora, and fauna globally.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our group members are not equalized in IT expertise, so Alessio and Vignesh are more expertise in IT than Anton. IT experts are required to update the best tools of hardware and software for project. We all are happy with categorized roles in team projects.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alessio finally has found the primary tool called</span> <a href="https://gomockingbird.com/home">GoMockingbird</a>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">, it possibly could handle our integrated ideas in one project.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Team projects are the foundation for solving problems. We create new tools based on the combination of existing software (as chatbots) and advantage equipment (Arduino system plus two electrical equipments)&nbsp; </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our respondents could be anyone in environment protectors, then we would like to introduce to them what a destructive environment looks like.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The color of design is the soul of a website, it will appeal to a substantial or singular&nbsp; group of people. It is the source of symbolism.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The balance of text, pictures, and contents in the project are essential foundation. Our project brings to children and teachers the balance of colorful pictures and temperature, from blue to red.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use the best balance between elements to sympathy with long time readers and researchers. In addition, we also replace more pictures than word description. People would rather&nbsp; watch action movies more than spending hours with thousands of words in detailed stories.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile website designs: the most important part of a project. Our team expert dedicates the best user interface for the highest achievement. We assure all necessary information will display anywhere on any devices.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The temperature input will describe in graphical demo for references, the traditional design gathers all international culture to enable monitoring what is happening around the specified locations.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creative design: very simple principle without it you definitely fail, you are more creative, you will be more attractive. This will require us to non-stop invent and reinvent our modules of the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our diplomatic design will get your attention at the first click.&nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We understand how our planet is in danger with high temperatures, so we will link all the relative blogs with questions and answers around the world with top leading news CNN, ABC, BBC, CNBC...&nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We create more games and outdoor activities for kids. The education program gives a new generation a boost to change the behavior on saving energy, recycle stuff to save our future planet out of pollution.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This project certainly had some challenges that were presented in the beginning, the first being our lack of experience with chatbots and developing a larger project from scratch. In order to complete the assessment it was very important to have good planning processes in place. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get started we decided like previous occasions to keep everything as simple and streamlined as possible to avoid unnecessary delays. This was achieved by using Facebook messenger for primary communication and working with Google drive to create and collaborate on documents and Skype for our video calls. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We then began by creating sub-headings for all the different aspects of the project and then organized amongst ourselves the most suitable parts and began working on them catching up approximately every 2 weeks for a Skype call and chatting on Facebook if we had any new ideas or questions along the way.&nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next up we began proof-reading and compiling all the information making sure it was correct and ready to be published. At this point I took all the content and started to assemble the website based on a design we all liked.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly we had a quick Skype chat to determine the direction of the video presentation and who would be responsible for different parts. This was especially important as we were in different locations. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We didn't have the opportunity to meet in person and conduct the video that way. Upon completion we each recorded the components of the video and edited if necessary before submitting all the files to the same shared folder we had established from here we began the process of editing and uploaded our the Google Drive folder ready for submission.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as the initial plan was concerned we aimed to get to a stage where we were at least able to have a functioning prototype. So far we are able to achieve this. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arduino seems to be working where it displays the temperature and humidity of the room and the chatbot seems to answer some of the questions presented to it by the user (see annex a). So all in all we are pretty happy with the progress. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of the dead end we initially wanted to present this to a group of young individuals at school across the state and if had the chance the country to inspire them to create using the tools of information technology.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But this soon became a myth as the time was no in our hands and we simply didn&rsquo;t have the resources and the appropriate networking to be able to achieve this. But if we have the chance in the future, we hope to do so.&nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were changes made to the project as outlined above and some of them were quite significant. The one that needed a particular note was the fact that we had to make our project a little more challenging which we did by adding a chatBot to the project. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the arduino and the chatBot have reached a stage where they can be displayed as a proof of concept but as we haven&rsquo;t had the chance to be able to work in the same location, we just couldn&rsquo;t test it out together. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we had the chance we would swap out the arduino for a raspberry Pi as it is capable of a lot more and it&rsquo;ll be a perfect fit with the chatbot as it&rsquo;ll be able to control both the sensors and the chatbot.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the project evolved, so did the aims and the reason why we doing this. Educating and inspiring young minds became second tier and the bushfire emergencies that shook the entire nation became the center point of why we wanted to follow through with this weather related project. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more we worked on it the more we started to appreciate why we went through the troubles of getting it done. It was nothing compared to some of the tragedies faced by people around VIC, NSW and QLD.</span></p>
                  <p><strong>Testing</strong></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After we finished building a mock of the temperature and humidity sensor using the arduino kit and then trying to incorporate that with the ChatBot we moved on to the testing phase. In the testing phase we started with some basic tests like does the arduino unit work and do what it is supposed to do. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chatbot was a bit more dynamic, the system runs of python programming language and needs vast pool of questions before it is fully operational but for the time being we have a proof of concept. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was tested the same way: does the chatbot load, then does it display answers to questions posed by the users.&nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the major problems such as issues of the systems not working were ironed out then we moved to the stage where the smaller, detailed problems were tackled such as their redundancies when users poses questions which are not within the data pool. Or when the temperature and humidity exceed the parameters of the sensors.&nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next stage was what happens if problems arise which once the users possess the prototype and will there be a quick troubleshooting guide which will make it easier for the user to troubleshoot the problem. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we moved on to thinking about the simple problems that occur with electronic items like why isn&rsquo;t the sensor showing the data - possible answer can be is the unit turned on or does the battery have enough charge?</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we completed the alpha stage testing, we moved to the beta stage where members of the public (usually just friends) were invited to try out the system. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They found some issues like the system doesn&rsquo;t respond for 30 seconds after the unit is turned on. We are still working on that. With the chatbot, the major feedback we got was that there needs to be a lot more questions but that can only be done with experts in meteorology and user interface designers who understand the needs of the public when it comes to the questions about weather.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We never had the opportunity to test the full system together rather the systems were tested individually as they are located in different parts of the country. The final testing can only be done with the full assembly.</span></p>
